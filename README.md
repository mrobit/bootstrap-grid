# Bootstrap Grid
Just a basic setup of the Bootstrap grid and the dependencies for it.

## Why?
I love Bootstrap but not all parts of it. Sometimes, I want to leave all the pre-defined stuff out and keep the grid (due to it being ridiculously easy to use.)

It's easier to just use this package instead of having to set up the imports. Really it was just to save a small amount of time in the future. It was also done to show off my ridiculous web dev prowess. Right guys? ... guys?
